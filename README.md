# Business-System-Analysis-and-Website-Prototype-Development

Main idea:

In the year of 2020, the Coronavirus Pandemic has gone global and governments both federal and local urge citizens to stay 6 feet apart while avoiding being in groups or indoors. In the town of Flemington, NJ, Bonacorsi Family Farm has kept their local population fed for generations. As a courtesy, the locals still want to support their local small business while staying safe. T4 has been tasked with transforming a traditional business with little technological capabilities into a quick and fast technologically literate curbside pickup station.


Solution to the problem:

Due to the ongoing Pandemic, both federal and local authorities recommend as little interactions as possible. The farmâ€™s customers are unable to enter the site indoors or pick their fruits outdoors as the farm is closed to all outsiders. The only way for customers to buy their fruits now is to buy them online and pick them up curbside. We will upgrade their website to enable updates on current inventory, ordering and paying online, choosing curbside pickup times, and generating sales reports.


Reason to fund/approve:

Our sponsor has approved this task to revolutionize this local farm technologically and allow it to safely stay in business. Otherwise, another small business will be lost due to the pandemic. With website capabilities where customers are able to pick and choose what and how many fruits they want to buy and pick up, Bonacorsi Family Farm is able to continue to support the local town while surviving the pandemic. This is an investment that is needed and will provide added benefits even after the pandemic, considering customer behavior has shifted to preferring online orders.

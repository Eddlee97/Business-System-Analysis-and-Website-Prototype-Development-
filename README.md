# Business System Analysis & Website Prototype Development
### Information Systems Program - Capstone Course
- Class: CIS 9590 Information Systems Development Project
- Project Timeframe: 4 months

## Project Summary:

As the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 ravaged cities big and small, traditional small businesses in need of modernization require much-needed assistance to survive in this landscape of weary consumers looking to protect themselves and their families. Bonacorsi family farms of Upper Deerfield is a small community food provider that has been in the Bonacorsi family for five generations. Due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the business has sharply declined, and without decisive help, the coming collapse of another small business is in order. Our team, T4 has been dispatched to re-connect local consumers with their community vendor of fruits. We aim to empower small businesses in these trying times by modernizing their technological reach while keeping both business and customers happy and safe. 

## Project Goal:
1. Streamline Bonacorsi Farmâ€™s Technical capabilities
2. Maintain and Improve presence during and after the global pandemic
3. Create additional channels of cash flow, and increase sales

## System Breakdown:
T4 will construct a new strategy for Bonacorsi family farm's customer-facing interface systems. For this project, T4 will be creating a website, database, inventory planning, and customer allocation system, allowing Bonacorsi to continue interacting with local customers safely during the coronavirus pandemic.

The purpose of a website is to exist as a user-friendly platform for all of our end-users. The primary function of the website is to create a technologically adept environment to improve the connectivity between the client and the business while also improving the cohesion between the business and its management staff. <br>
- Client-side: System will allow customers to interact with the business by allowing customers to create an account, add multiple items to their shopping cart, purchase said item(s), place and pay for their order, enter important information, view their account and order status, and receive notifications. 
- Business side: System will receive information about the order(s) from the customer and the pick-up information. Orders can be managed to be picked up by the customer in a safe fashion during the pandemic while adding another channel of revenue in a more technologically advanced world. In return, the business will have an efficient way to manage customers and their inventory with the database system created. Without the need for their traditional way of recording data, Bonacorsi farms will be able to utilize their data more effectively through analysis. 
- Reporting: Management staff will be able to query data that is collected through the website's database functionalities. This will allow management to look into the performance of products and review customer order preferences.

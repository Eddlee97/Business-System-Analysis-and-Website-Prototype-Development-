# Business System Analysis & Website Prototype Development
### Information Systems Program - Capstone Course
- Class: CIS 9590 Information Systems Development Project
- Project Timeframe: 4 months

## Project Summary:

As the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 ravaged cities big and small, traditional small businesses in need of modernization require much-needed assistance to survive in this landscape of weary consumers looking to protect themselves and their families. Bonacorsi family farms of Upper Deerfield is a small community food provider that has been in the Bonacorsi family for five generations. Due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the business has sharply declined, and without decisive help, the coming collapse of another small business is in order. Our team, T4 has been dispatched to re-connect local consumers with their community vendor of fruits. We aim to empower small businesses in these trying times by modernizing their technological reach while keeping both business and customers happy and safe. 

## Project Goal:
1. Streamline Bonacorsi Farm’s Technical capabilities
2. Maintain and Improve presence during and after the global pandemic
3. Create additional channels of cash flow, and increase sales

## System Breakdown:
T4 will construct a new strategy for Bonacorsi family farm's customer-facing interface systems. For this project, T4 will be creating a website, database, inventory planning, and customer allocation system, allowing Bonacorsi to continue interacting with local customers safely during the coronavirus pandemic.

The purpose of a website is to exist as a user-friendly platform for all of our end-users. The primary function of the website is to create a technologically adept environment to improve the connectivity between the client and the business while also improving the cohesion between the business and its management staff. <br>
- Client-side: System will allow customers to interact with the business by allowing customers to create an account, add multiple items to their shopping cart, purchase said item(s), place and pay for their order, enter important information, view their account and order status, and receive notifications. 
- Business side: System will receive information about the order(s) from the customer and the pick-up information. Orders can be managed to be picked up by the customer in a safe fashion during the pandemic while adding another channel of revenue in a more technologically advanced world. In return, the business will have an efficient way to manage customers and their inventory with the database system created. Without the need for their traditional way of recording data, Bonacorsi farms will be able to utilize their data more effectively through analysis. 
- Reporting: Management staff will be able to query data that is collected through the website's database functionalities. This will allow management to look into the performance of products and review customer order preferences.

## System Features & Prototype
- **Navigation & Pages:**
  - **Home page navigation:**
    - As soon as you open the webpage you are greeted with a menu bar that gives the options to go to the Fruits page, the DIY/Package page or Customer Service. On the right side, there is a shopping bag icon that directs the customers to the shopping cart. Besides that, there’s a Login button that links to the Sign In/Sign Up page. The rest of the home page contains imagery that portrays the farm business, a section for quick access to fruits available for purchase, and below that an informative paragraph that informs the customer about the business. The About section also has the Get in Touch button that directs the viewer to a different page where they can leave their contact information and ask any questions or concerns. Lastly, the page footer shows the farm address as well as the business contact information. Everything on one page makes it easier and more convenient and appealing for customers to navigate and purchase from the website.
  - **DIY/Gift packages:**
    - The website will help customers to buy different fruits that the farm produces and also get different fruit packages. There will be a separate menu option that displays and links to the DIY/Gift packages. When clicking there they will be brought to the new page that displays the different packages divided into two categories: Gift Basket and Premium Fruit. On the page, the customers will see a picture that represents what the packages will look like, a brief description of them, and the option to buy them. When customers click on the ‘Add to Cart’ button they will be redirected to a new page that opens up linking to the product page. Some of the packages have different options to choose from, so once the customer chooses the option, the amount and input pickup information if they are doing curbside pickup, they can click on the page’s ‘Add to Cart’ and they will have the chosen product on their shopping cart. They can then click on the Cart icon in the upper right corner of the page and be directed there where they can choose their payment option and checkout.
- **User Input & Transaction:**
  - **How to create a user profile:**
    - One way to have a faster checkout experience is to have an online account with your information saved. That is why our website offers that option also. Additionally, management is interested in tracking new vs returning users, and established profiles help in making the distinction. To create a profile the customer clicks on the ‘Login’ button in the upper right corner of the Home page. They will be directed to the ‘Login’ screen that asks them if they already have an account or if they want to ‘Sign Up’ for one. New customers click on ‘Sign Up’ and are brought to the page that asks them for an email and password for the account. Once the customer fills those out, they click on Sign up and they have created their account.
  - **How to put in an order:**
    - To start an order customers have to choose the products they want to purchase. There are a couple of ways to go for that, but the most common and straightforward way would be to go to the ‘Fruit’ page that contains all products being sold. The customer clicks on the product they want to buy. They are brought to the product page where they need to choose the quantity they want to purchase. After that, they need to fill in their pick-up information in a note box on the product page. If they prefer shipping instead, they need to enter ‘N/A’. After that, they click on the ‘Add to Cart’ button, and the product is added to the cart, shown on a mini cart page on the right side of the screen. The customer can either continue to the Cart page to pay or continue shopping. Once they have all the desired products in Cart, they click on the Cart icon in the upper right corner of the webpage and click ‘Checkout’. Returning customers will have their information prefilled while new customers will have to fill in their information. They will choose the shipping option for the product, then the page will direct to the payment option and once that is entered the customer clicks on ‘Checkout’, and the order is placed. The screen refreshes and gives the customer a confirmation ID in the upper center, a list of items ordered as well as shipping/pickup instructions.
- **Editing Transaction:**
  - **How to change phone number in My Account:**
    - To change personal information in a created account, the customer has to go to the account page. To do that they can click on the My Account icon in the top right corner of the webpage. They will be redirected to the My Account page where they will have the option to change the First and Last name, phone number, profile picture, and cover picture for their profile. To change the phone number, the user needs to delete the one entered and input the correct number. Once that is done, the Update info button will become available in the upper right corner of the screen. By clicking on that the new information is saved. The customer can confirm this by logging off and logging in again.
- **Running Report & Querying Backend Database for Data:**
  - **Report on page visits:**
    - One of the benefits of creating a webpage that serves as an online source is the ease of running reports. In order to make the best of the page, one of the things management has to understand is where the traffic is coming from. Page visits report on Wix gives a clear picture of visits by page. That is helpful in determining which is the page that attracts the most customers and is the one that is referred to the most. To generate the report, management opens up the Wix manager webpage, goes to the Analytics & Reports section in the left-hand corner, and selects reports. Based on the frequency of using this report may either be on the top of the list, or you can scroll to its appropriate section ‘Behavior’. Once you select the report a new page opens up with criteria to choose from in order to generate the report. One can choose to have a bar chart or table, and then choose a time period to see the activity, comparability to a previous period, and measurement criteria. Once all is selected the page refreshes displaying the required report. You have the option to download the report as a CSV or an excel file.

## Implementation
- Executive Summary:
Our system implementation process was tasked with each of our team's strengths. The importance of bringing a system to life from scratch for a traditional technological-less company gave us the oversight of the need for an organized process. Using the various project management techniques learned throughout the semester, T4 utilized every single necessary aspect to combat inefficiency. 

When planning the project scope, the determination of the creation of what type of system was one of our number one priorities. Through deliberation, we agreed on the website hosted online rather than in-house, due to many existing functionalities that come with the website platform builder. The scalability factor for a small business in the environment we are currently in also played into the factor of T4's choice of system. The website system is very intuitive and consists of pages that can assist all end-users. In addition, anyone will be able to access the website in the future and continue improving and making positive changes.
